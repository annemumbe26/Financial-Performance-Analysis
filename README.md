# Global Financial Performance Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the fiscal performance of a global company across various regions, products, and segments using a Microsoft financial dataset. The goal was to identify primary drivers of success and uncover critical profitability gaps.

## Methodology: CRISP-DM
I followed the industry-standard **CRISP-DM** framework:
1. **Business Understanding:** Identifying the $600k profit leak in the Enterprise segment.
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned 700+ records using `TRIM`, `PROPER`, and logic-based standardization.
3. **Data Modelling:** Built Pivot Tables and Calculated Fields for "Profit Margin %".
4. **Evaluation:** Discovered that while Government is highly profitable ($11.38M), Enterprise is failing due to high COGS.
5. **Deployment:** Created a dynamic Excel Dashboard for stakeholder decision-making.

## Key Insights
- **The Profit Leak:** Enterprise segment loss of over **$600,000**.
- **The Leader:** Government segment profit of **$11.38M**.
- **Top Product:** Paseo ($4.79M profit).

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** Advanced Formulas, Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Data Modeling.
- **Framework:** CRISP-DM.

## How to View the Dashboard
1. Download the `.xlsx` file from this repository.
2. Open in Excel and use the **Slicers** to filter by Country or Product.
